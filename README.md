# DM-Spammer 

This is a short and simple tool made in Python. It sends a direct message (DM) to every member in a Discord server by using a Discord bot to message the members directly.

# Installation

# Linux

The installation is pretty simple. To install this tool on Linux, you git clone this repository like this in your terminal: ``git clone https://github.com/BillySap12/DM-Spammer``. If for some reason your Linux Distribution does not have git pre-installed, you can simply install git using ``sudo apt install git`` (for Debian-based distros) or ``sudo pacman -S git`` (for Arch-based distros) and then git cloning this repository.

After you have done that, navigate to the newly-made directory by doing ``cd DM-Spammer``.

Once you have navigated into the directory, install all the requirements by doing ``pip -r install requirements.txt``. Please note, that in some cases, you will have to create a virtual environment. To create one, execute ``python3 -m venv myenv`` in your terminal. Afterwards, you will have to enable it by running ``source myenv/bin/activate``. After that, you will be able to run the command with no problems.

Now run the program by doing ``python3 main.py``.

# Windows & MacOS

For Windows or Mac, go to the repository (https://github.com/BillySap12/DM-Spammer).

There should be a green button that says "Code".

Click on it, and then press the "Download ZIP" button.

Wait for it to download.

Once it has downloaded, go to the directory where it was downloaded. Extract all of its components.

Open your cmd, and write the following: ``cd path/where/the/zip/got/downloaded`` (replace ``path/where/the/zip/got/dowloaded`` with your actual path).

Also, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. The recommended version is 3.13.3, as this is the version this tool was made in.
Once you have done that, run: pip install -r requirements.txt.

Wait for them to download.

Now, go back to your File Explorer, and double click on the main.py file.

That should run the program.
